Natural Language Processing

Field of computer science and linguistics

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science and especially artificial intelligence. It is primarily concerned with providing computers with the ability to process data encoded in natural language and is thus closely related to information retrieval, knowledge representation and computational linguistics, a subfield of linguistics.

Major tasks in natural language processing are speech recognition, text classification, natural-language understanding, and natural-language generation.

NLP engineers work on developing applications like chatbots, sentiment analysis tools, and language translation programs, which are integral to modern technology and communication systems.

NLP engineers are in high demand across various industries. Companies like Apple, Google, and Amazon are actively hiring NLP engineers to develop cutting-edge technologies.
Roles can range from software engineers to senior positions like Lead NLP Engineer, where you might be responsible for overseeing the development of NLP applications and leading teams of engineers.
